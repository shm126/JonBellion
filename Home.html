			Of all the artists I typically hear on the radio to the ones all my friends rave about, Jon Bellion
			is one of those musicians that fall under neither. This might sound typical to hear when being told
			a description of an artist but Jon Bellion has a total style of his own. His mutations of hip-hop/pop tempos and
			rhythms paired with his very indie rock/acoustic sounding voice is a rarity. Because he makes it sound great all 
			while it being simple.Hailing from Long Island, New york, the 25 year old has officialy been a part of the music 
			industry since 2012, pumping out 4 mixtapes.So he is just beginning. With tracks like <em>Beautiful Now</em> with 
			Zedd and <em>Trumpets</em> by Jason Derulo under his belt, I look forward to his first official album <em>The Human 
			Condition</em> coming out in June 2016 very VERY much.
